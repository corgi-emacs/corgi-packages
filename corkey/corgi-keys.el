;;; Usage:

;; This file contains Corgi's built-in key bindings. Your own bindings should go
;; in `user-keys.el' in your `user-emacs-directory'. Use `SPC f e k'
;; (`corgi/open-user-keys-file') to create a stub version and open it.
;;
;; Bindings here are nested, e.g. `("SPC" ("b" ("k" kill-buffer)))' means that
;; "space" followed by "b" and then "k" will invoke `M-x kill-buffer'.
;;
;; You can add a descriptions before the command, this will show up in a pop-up
;; when you press the prefix key and wait a bit. (This uses which-key)
;;
;; Instead of a prefix key you can use a symbol like `normal' or `insert', which
;; designates the Evil state (what vim calls the mode). `global' means any
;; state, `normal|visual' means either normal or visual.
;;
;; Instead of a command like `kill-buffer' you can put a keyword like
;; `:eval/buffer'. This is called a "signal". In the `corgi-signals' (or
;; `user-signals') file these are bound to specific commands based on the major
;; mode. E.g. in Emacs Lisp `:eval/buffer' means `eval-buffer', whereas in
;; Clojure it means `cider-eval-buffer'.
;;
;; If you want to alter Corgi's bindings directly then copy this file to your
;; `user-emacs-directory', and Corgi will pick up your local version instead of
;; the version it ships with.

;;; Grammar:

;; <target>  := <signal> | <command>
;; <prefix>  := <state> | <key>
;; <state>   := 'normal' | 'insert' | 'visual' | 'emacs' | 'motion' | 'global'
;; <key>     := stringp
;; <doc>     := stringp
;; <signal>  := keywordp
;; <command> := symbolp
